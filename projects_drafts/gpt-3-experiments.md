## GPT-3 Experiments

One day in class my professor mentioned that he had heard of [this AI](https://openai.com/api/) that was able to write entire short film scripts. Months later I decided to try it out, and found out that I can do much more.

Thus started my relationship with GPT-3. 

Now, I've built a **Basic Completions Generator**, a **PDF summarizer**, a **'Key Points' Extracter**, and a **Powerpoint to Quizlet Converter**. I'm going to break each of these down and link the code. Now, this isnt the end goal, but it's a start. Its been invaluable to spend time with the model, learning how it behaves and how to design prompts to elicit the response I want.

The next plan for GPT-3 is to train it on literature from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and see how it could be used to answer contextual questions from clients, assist clinicians with DBT training, and serve as a "search engine" for the DBT documentation.

### My Process for Working with GPT-3

1. Mess around in the OpenAI [playground](https://openai.com/api)
2. Determine ideal prompt design
3. Successfully elicit the desired response manually
4. Build a python script to call the API and elicit the desired response programmatically
5. Test and Debug
