When I applied for graduate social work programs, each required a 6-page statement of purpose that included a statement of intent and how one would address complex social issues.

I wrote 7 of them, the final drafts totaling 42 pages. I did an average of 7 revisions on each statement - both content and grammar.

*When writing, I was forced to take my raw thoughts and ideas and put them in a polished form that others could read and understand.* That process forced me to cultivate and nurture my ideas, growing them into something better. 

Even if no one ever read the statements, I had significantly progressed my understanding of my topic (what I was writing about). 

So, I’ll be using this blog as a reason to write more. *Even if no one ever reads them, the simple act of writing posts for others to read will foster new ideas and insights that I would otherwise never know.* It will force me to become increasingly acquainted with myself. 

Also, I’d like to produce some influential writing at some point in my life, so I better start practicing.

Here are a few post ideas I’ve come up with thus far. 

1. Lifelong Learning Is Better Than A’s
2. Thank God For Python: Why Passion Projects Matter
3. Anthropology Matters: 3 Reasons Why Cross-functional Knowledge Breeds Innovation
4. Breaking Down My List of 100 Useful Development and Design Tools
5. How I Used AI To Automate My Schoolwork

I’m well occupied right now between school, development, and my personal life, so I’m not sure how soon these will come, but I’m excited, nonetheless.
