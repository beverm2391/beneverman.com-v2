## Design

I am not a graphic designer, at least not primarily. However, I can't afford to pay any designer what they're worth, so I ended up doing all of the design myself.

#### Figma

I have never used Figma until now. It is *phenominal*. Exactly what I need for designing multiple pages with a unifying style. Note, I haven't yet taken advantage of many of Figma's features like prototyping and smart animating. 

#### Adobe Illustrator

I know next to nothing about Illustrator, but I can follow tutorials. Any logo or type design was probbaly done (with lots of trial and error) in Illustraor. This will be one of the first things I hire out in the future.

#### Adobe After Effects

I used Adobe After Effects mainly for building animations, which were exported to JSON for implementation with the Lottie Files React library.

## Development
### Picking The Stack

1. HTML/CSS
2. JavaScript Framework: React
3. JavaScript Framework: Next.js

I decided on the React/Next.js mini-stack because, well, it was one I could understand that also offered me the functionality I wanted. I didn't want to have to update code manually when I "posted" a new project writeup or blog article. So, I'm automatically rendering markdown files into React components, which are then assigned a dynamically generated url by Next.js. I can also add a backend if I'd like (I'll probbably start with Firebase).

## Future Upgrades

The next things I'll tackle are SEO optimization and adding cooler animations, though I might get distracted by another project, we'll see.
