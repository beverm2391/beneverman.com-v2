## Intro

I built version one of beneverman.com with HTMl/CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It was a single portfolio page with some interactivity, and some okay design work. You can check it out here: [beneverman.com](https://beneverman.com). It was a great first version, and a great way to learn HTML/CSS and basic JavaScript. But, I decided it was time for some improvements, and clean code that I wouldn't be empbarassed to share.

The core functionality that I wanted to add included: automatic rendering of new blog posts from markdown, automatic generation of the post url, a place where I could proudly showcase my development projects, and much better design.

I am not a graphic designer, at least not primarily. However, I can't afford to pay any designer what they're worth, so I ended up doing all of the design myself. For version 1, I did all of the "graphic design" as I developed. I wanted to see a new layout, I coded it and then decided. Of course, this was ultimately inefficient, so this time I used Figma to design the layout. I had some help from Illustrator for type design and AfterEffects for animations.

#### Figma

I have never used Figma until now. It is *phenominal*. Exactly what I need for designing multiple pages with a unifying style. Note, I haven't yet taken advantage of many of Figma's features like prototyping and smart animating. 

#### Adobe Illustrator

I know next to nothing about Illustrator, but I can follow tutorials. Any logo or type design was probbaly done (with lots of trial and error) in Illustraor. This will be one of the first things I hire out in the future.

#### Adobe After Effects

I used Adobe After Effects mainly for building animations, which were exported to JSON for implementation with the Lottie Files React library.

## Development

### Picking The Stack

1. HTML/CSS
2. React
3. Next.js

I decided on the React/Next.js mini-stack because, well, it was one I could understand that also offered me the functionality I wanted. I didn't want to have to update code manually when I "posted" a new project writeup or blog article. So, I'm automatically rendering markdown files into React components, which are then assigned a dynamically generated url by Next.js. I can also add a backend if I'd like (I'll probbably start with Firebase).

### Biggest Challenges

Rendering Markdown
Picking the most effective solution, 
    Css first, JS second
Staying Focused

The next things I'll tackle are SEO optimization and adding cooler animations, though I might get distracted by another project, we'll see.

### Concluding

For now, I'll focus on creating efective project write-ups and relevant blog posts.
