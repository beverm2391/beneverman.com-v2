## Where did the idea come from?

#### Overwhelmed By Schoolwork
#### What is GPT-3? - How I Got Started

## What can the application do (in its current state)?
#### Use Case Continuum
#### What it's good at, what its bad at.

## How did you build it?
#### How I learned to use GPT-3
#### How a simple script evolved over time (refactoring)
#### Challenges and Roadblocks

1. Token Limit
2. Runtime
3. Compute Cost

## Whats next for the project?

## What have you learned while building this?

1. Don't give up on a project - you have to dream big.
2. As a new developer, pick at least one project that no guide/tutorial/course exists for. It forces you to problem solve with only docs and experimentation.
